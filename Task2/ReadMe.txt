CODING SAMURAI - PYTHON DEVELOPMENT INTERNSHIP (TASK 2)

Project Title: Weather Forecast Application

Project Description: Create a simple command-line weather forecast application
in Python that provides users with current weather information for a specified location.
This project will involve making API requests, parsing JSON data, and displaying the information to the user.

Key Features you can include:
    Location input: Allow users to enter a city or location for which they want to get the weather forecast.
    API Integration: Use a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch current weather data for the specified location.
    Display weather data: Present the weather information to the user,
            including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
    Error handling: Handle cases where the user enters an invalid location or the API request fails gracefully.
    Unit conversion: Provide options for users to choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature units.
